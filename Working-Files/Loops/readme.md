# Loops

## Objective

The purpose of these exercises is to learn how to loop through php code and html code.

## Exercises

Create a file index.php
At the top of the file, create an array like the one below (with at least 8 shows in it)
Loop through the array posting the rating and the tv show's name in a table row
Now make the tv-show name clickable and link it to a google search about that tv show
Lastly, instead of the number of the rating of this tv show, make a loop inside the current loop to give the number of stars instead of rating (use icons)

The results are [here](https://loops-php.herokuapp.com/)
